## Build Order Summary

```
Landing (H1–3) → Login (H4) → App Shell (H5)
→ Dashboard UI mock (H6–9) → Classes UI mock (H10–13)
→ Assignment UI mock (H14–19) → Progress Report UI mock (H20–23)
→ Backend APIs (H24–33) → Connect everything (H34–39)
→ Deploy (H40)
```

> **Rule:** If you get stuck on a UI component, drop a `// TODO: connect to API` comment and move on. The goal in Phase 1–5 is pixel-perfect UI with clean mock data. APIs come after.
